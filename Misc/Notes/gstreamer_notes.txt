The only other “development environment” that is required is the gcc compiler and a text editor. In order to compile code that requires GStreamer and uses the GStreamer core library, remember to add this string to your gcc command:

pkg-config --cflags --libs gstreamer-1.0

Basic pipeline: source -> filter -> sink
